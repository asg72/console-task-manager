## Description
- A simple to-do list application in C++ designed to manage tasks efficiently.
- This project is a beginner-friendly exercise in file handling and object-oriented programming, with two versions of the code: one using classes and another using functions.

## Features
- Add a Task: Create new tasks with ease.
- View Tasks: Display the list of current tasks.
- Delete a Task: Remove completed or unnecessary tasks.
- Save to File: Automatically saves tasks to a file for future use.
- Load from File: Loads tasks from a file when the program starts.

## Project Structure
The project currently has two C++ files:
1. task_manager_classes.cpp - Version using classes.
2. task_manager_functions.cpp - Version using functions.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   git clone https://github.com/username/task-manager.git
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   cd task-manager
   
### Running the Program
1. **Compile either version of the program**:
   g++ task_manager_classes.cpp -o task_manager
   or
   g++ task_manager_functions.cpp -o task_manager
2. **Run the compiled program**:
   ./task_manager
   
## Usage
1. Follow on-screen instructions to add, view, or delete tasks.
2. Task data is saved to a file so it persists between program runs.

## Future Enhancements
- Add Task Priorities: Allow users to set priority levels for each task.
- Task Deadlines: Include due dates for tasks.
- Search Functionality: Implement a search feature to quickly find tasks.
- User Interface Improvements: Add a more user-friendly display.
